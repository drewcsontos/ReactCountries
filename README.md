# React Countries
Note: rest api down, but fix coming soon.
Go to https://drewcsontos.github.io/ReactCountries to check out my project.

This website requests data from the api https://restcountries.eu to get a list of countries and data about them. It then lists them off and lets the user search for them.

Made as an exercise from the course https://fullstackopen.com/en/.
